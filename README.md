# Match Device to Link Station

This project provides a solution to the following problem:

- There are _link stations_ with a location (x, y) and reach (r)
- There are _devices_ with location (x, y)
- Link station power can be calculated with the following formula:
  - _power_ = (reach - device's distance from link station)^2
  - if distance > reach, power = 0

_Target:_ find a most suitable link station (with most power) for a device to connect to.
